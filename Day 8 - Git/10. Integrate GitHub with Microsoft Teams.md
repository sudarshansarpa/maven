## ✅ **Integrate GitHub with Microsoft Teams – Step-by-Step Guide**

### 🔹 **Step 1: Install the GitHub App in Teams**

1. Open **Microsoft Teams** (Web/Desktop).
2. On the left sidebar, click on **"Apps"**.
3. In the search bar, type **GitHub**.
4. Click on the **GitHub** app (published by Microsoft Corporation).
5. Click the **“Open”** or **“Add”** button.
6. Choose where to install it:

   * **Chat**: For personal integration.
   * **Team/Channel**: For team-wide integration.
7. Click **“Set up”** or **“Add to a Team”** and select the **Team or Channel** (e.g., `DevOps Team`).

### 🔹 **Step 2: Connect Your GitHub Account**

1. Once installed, go to the **chat window with GitHub** (found in the left sidebar or in Teams > Chat).
2. Type:

   ```
   @GitHub signin
   ```
3. Teams will reply with a **Sign-in button**.
4. Click **Sign in**, and it will open a browser window.
5. **Authorize** the GitHub App to access your GitHub account.
6. After successful login, it will return to Teams and confirm you're connected.


### 🔹 **Step 3: Configure GitHub in Microsoft Teams**

1. Go to the **channel** or **chat** where you want GitHub updates.
2. Use the command to subscribe to a repo:

   ```
   @GitHub subscribe techworldwithmurali/helmchart
   ```
3. GitHub bot will confirm the subscription.


### 🔹 **Step 4: Customize or Confirm Subscription**

You can customize what events you want (optional):

Example:

```bash
@GitHub subscribe techworldwithmurali/helmchart issues, pulls, commits
```

To see available options:

```bash
@GitHub help
```

### 🔹 **Step 5: Raise a Pull Request**

1. Go to your GitHub repo:
   [https://github.com/techworldwithmurali/helmchart](https://github.com/techworldwithmurali/helmchart)
2. Create a new branch and make a change.
3. Commit the changes and open a **Pull Request** targeting the main branch.
4. Add a title and description, then click **"Create Pull Request"**.

### 🔹 **Step 6: Verify Notification in Microsoft Teams**

1. Open the **Teams channel/chat** where the repo is subscribed.

2. Within a few seconds, you should see a message like:

   > **New Pull Request** by Murali: *“Fix typo in values.yaml”* in `techworldwithmurali/helmchart`

3. If you don’t see the notification:

   * Double-check the repository is **public**, or the **GitHub App has access** to your private repo.
   * Run:

     ```
     @GitHub subscriptions
     ```

     to verify if your repo is listed.
