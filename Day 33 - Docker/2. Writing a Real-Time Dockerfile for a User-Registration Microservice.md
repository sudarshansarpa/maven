## Writing a Real-Time Dockerfile for a User-Registration Microservice

This repository contains the Dockerfile for building a Docker image for a User-Registration microservice built with Java 17 (OpenJDK). The service is packaged as a JAR file and is intended to run within a Docker container.

```Dockerfile
# Use an OpenJDK base image
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR file from the target directory to the container
COPY target/*.jar /app/user-registration.jar

# Expose the application's port (update if your application uses a specific port)
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the application
CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app/user-registration.jar"]
````

## Dockerfile Breakdown

The Dockerfile contains the following steps:

1. **Base Image:**

   * We are using the `openjdk:17-jdk-slim` image, which is a slimmed-down version of the JDK, providing a minimal setup for running Java applications.

   ```dockerfile
   FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
   ```

2. **Working Directory:**

   * The working directory inside the container is set to `/app`. This is where the application will reside inside the container.

   ```dockerfile
   WORKDIR /app
   ```

3. **Copy JAR File:**

   * The `target/*.jar` is copied into the container's `/app` directory, and it's renamed as `user-registration.jar`.

   ```dockerfile
   COPY target/*.jar /app/user-registration.jar
   ```

4. **Expose Application Port:**

   * The Docker container exposes port `8080`, which is the default port the application listens on. (Make sure to update this if your application uses a different port).

   ```dockerfile
   EXPOSE 8080
   ```

5. **Run Application:**

   * The container will run the Java application using the command: `java -jar /app/user-registration.jar`.

   ```dockerfile
   CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app/user-registration.jar"]
   ```

## Build and Run the Docker Container

### 1. Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, run the following command from the root directory of your project:

```bash
docker build -t user-registration-microservice .
```

### 2. Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run the container using:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 user-registration-microservice
```

This will run the application on port 8080 of your local machine. Access the microservice by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser or making API calls to this endpoint.

## Notes

* Ensure that your `target/*.jar` file is generated before building the Docker image. Typically, this would be done by running a build tool like Maven or Gradle.
* If your application uses a different port, modify the `EXPOSE` directive and the `docker run` command accordingly.
