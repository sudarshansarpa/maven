# 🐳 What is a Docker Container?

A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that contains everything needed to run a piece of software, including the application code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and configuration settings.

Containers are created from Docker images and run in isolated environments, ensuring consistent behavior of applications across different development, testing, and production environments.

## 🧱 Key Features of Docker Containers

* ✅ Lightweight: Shares the host OS kernel, unlike VMs which require full guest OS.
* 🚀 Fast Startup: Launches in seconds.
* 🧩 Portable: Runs the same way in development, testing, and production.
* 🔐 Isolated: Each container runs independently in its own environment.

**Container images** are like **frozen blueprints** – they **never change**.

**Containers** are like **temporary houses** built from those blueprints – you can move furniture around inside, but when you destroy the house, all changes are gone.

So:

* ✅ **Images = Immutable (unchangeable)**
* ⚠️ **Containers = Changeable (but temporary)**
