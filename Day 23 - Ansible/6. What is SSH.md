### 🔐 What is SSH?

**SSH (Secure Shell)** is a **network protocol** used to securely connect to and control remote computers over an **unsecured network**.

> Think of SSH as a secure way to "remote control" a server or system from your terminal.

## ✅ Key Features of SSH:

| Feature                | Description                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 **Encrypted**       | All data is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.                       |
| 👤 **Authentication**  | Requires username/password or SSH key (preferred).                    |
| 🖥️ **Remote Access**  | Allows you to run commands, copy files, and manage systems remotely.  |
| 📁 **File Transfer**   | Used with `scp` or `sftp` for secure file transfers.                  |
| 🔄 **Port Forwarding** | Can securely tunnel other traffic (like DB connections or web ports). |

## 🔧 How SSH Works:

1. You run a command like:

   ```bash
   ssh user@hostname
   ```

2. SSH:

   * Initiates a **handshake**.
   * **Authenticates** using password or key.
   * **Encrypts** the entire session.

3. Once connected, you can run shell commands as if you're sitting at the remote machine.

## 🔑 SSH Authentication Methods:

* **Password-based** (less secure)
* **Key-based** (more secure — uses public/private key pair)

  * Private key stays with you.
  * Public key is added to the remote server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

## 🛠️ Common SSH Commands:

| Command                              | Purpose                           |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `ssh user@host`                      | Login to remote server            |
| `scp file.txt user@host:/path/`      | Copy file to remote server        |
| `ssh -i key.pem user@host`           | Login with a private key          |

## 🌐 Example:

```bash
ssh ec2-user@192.168.1.100
```

> Connects to a remote server with IP `192.168.1.100` as user `ec2-user`.
