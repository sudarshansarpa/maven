## Installing Docker on Windows

To install Docker on Windows, follow these steps:

### 1. **Check System Requirements**

Docker Desktop for Windows requires:

* **Windows 10 or 11** (Pro, Enterprise, or Education) with **Hyper-V** and **Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2)** enabled.
* **Virtualization** must be enabled in BIOS.

### 2. **Download Docker Desktop for Windows**

Go to the official Docker website and download the installer:

* [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### 3. **Install Docker Desktop**

Once the installer is downloaded, follow these steps:

1. **Run the installer**: Double-click the `.exe` file you downloaded.
2. **Follow the installation wizard**: The installer will guide you through the installation process. Ensure that the options to enable **WSL 2** and **Hyper-V** are selected during installation.

### 4. **Enable WSL 2 and Virtualization (if not enabled)**

Docker Desktop requires **WSL 2** for Windows, which is an advanced feature of Windows Subsystem for Linux.

* **Enable WSL 2**: If it’s not already installed, Docker Desktop will prompt you to install and enable WSL 2. Follow the instructions provided by Docker to enable WSL 2. This typically involves:

  * Installing **Windows Subsystem for Linux** by running this command in PowerShell (run as Administrator):

  ```bash
  wsl --install
  ```

  * **Set WSL 2 as the default version**:

  ```bash
  wsl --set-default-version 2
  ```

* **Enable Virtualization**: Make sure that **Virtualization Technology** is enabled in your system's BIOS. This is required for Hyper-V to work.

### 5. **Launch Docker Desktop**

Once the installation is complete, launch Docker Desktop from the Start menu. The first time you launch Docker Desktop, it may take a few minutes to initialize.

### 6. **Verify Docker Installation**

Once Docker is running, you can verify the installation by running the following command in PowerShell or Command Prompt:

```bash
docker --version
```

You can also check if Docker is running by executing:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This will pull a test image and run it, printing a "Hello from Docker!" message if everything is working correctly.

### 7. **Log in to Docker Hub (Optional)**

If you have a Docker Hub account, you can log in to access Docker images stored in your Hub repositories:

```bash
docker login
```

This will prompt you to enter your Docker Hub credentials.

### 8. **Update Docker Desktop**

Occasionally, Docker Desktop will notify you about available updates. You can install updates directly from the Docker Desktop interface. Keep your Docker installation up-to-date for security patches and new features.
