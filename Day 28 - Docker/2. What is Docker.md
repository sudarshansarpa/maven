### **What is Docker?**

- Docker is an **open-source platform** used to develop, ship, and run applications inside **containers**.
- Containers package an application along with its required **libraries**, **binaries**, and **dependencies**, ensuring it runs reliably across different computing environments.

- Docker helps developers to **build once and run anywhere**—whether it's on a developer’s laptop, on-premises servers, or in the cloud.


### **Why Do We Use Docker?**

* **Portability:** Run applications consistently across different environments.
* **Lightweight:** Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more efficient than virtual machines.
* **Fast Delivery & Scalability:** Speeds up development, testing, and deployment workflows.
* **Resource Optimization:** Better use of system resources with minimal overhead.
* **Isolation:** Run multiple containers (with isolated apps and environments) on a single host.
* **CI/CD & Testing:** Ideal for **continuous integration and deployment**, automated testing, and rapid iteration.
