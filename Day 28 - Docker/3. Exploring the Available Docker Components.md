## 🚢 Docker Architecture Overview

Docker relies on a **client-server** architecture with three core components and several supporting elements:

### 🧱 Core Components

1. **Docker Client**
2. **Docker Host (Engine)**
3. **Docker Registry**

### 🔧 Supporting Components

* Docker Images
* Docker Containers
* Docker Network
* Docker Storage

---

## 1. 🖥️ Docker Client

**Definition:**
The Docker client is the primary interface used by developers and system administrators to interact with Docker. It is the command-line tool (`docker`) used to send commands.

**Key Points:**

* Sends commands like `build`, `pull`, `run`, `stop`, `rm`, `images`, etc.
* Communicates with the Docker daemon (`dockerd`) via:

  * **REST API**
  * **UNIX socket** (default on Linux)
  * **TCP socket** (for remote access)
* It **can be located on a different machine** from the Docker host, allowing **remote Docker management**.

---

## 2. 🐳 Docker Host (Engine)

**Definition:**
The Docker host runs the **Docker Engine**, which includes the Docker **daemon** responsible for building, running, and managing Docker containers.

**Key Responsibilities:**

* Running the `dockerd` service (Docker daemon)
* Managing:

  * **Containers**
  * **Images**
  * **Networks**
  * **Volumes**
* Processing requests from the Docker client

---

## 3. 📦 Docker Registry

**Definition:**
A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images. It's where images are pushed to and pulled from.

### 🔹 Types of Registries:

#### ✅ Docker Hub (Public Cloud Registry)

* Maintained by Docker Inc.
* Offers:

  * **Public repositories** (freely accessible images)
  * **Private repositories** (restricted access)
* Common source for base images (like Ubuntu, Nginx, MySQL)

#### 🏢 Local Docker Registry (Private On-Prem)

* Hosted inside an organization’s internal network
* Faster image access and better control over:

  * Image versions
  * Security policies
* Often used in CI/CD pipelines to reduce reliance on Docker Hub

**Pull Logic:**

* Docker will **check the local registry** first
* If the image isn't found, it will **fallback to Docker Hub**

---

## 4. 🧬 Docker Images

* Read-only templates used to create containers
* Built using Dockerfiles
* Consist of stacked layers for caching and reusability

---

## 5. 📦 Docker Containers

* Runtime instances of Docker images
* Lightweight, isolated environments
* Share the host OS kernel but run independently

---

## 6. 🌐 Docker Network

* Manages container communication (internal and external)
* Types:

  * **Bridge** (default for standalone containers)
  * **Host**
  * **Overlay** (for Swarm or multi-host networking)
  * **None**

---

## 7. 💾 Docker Storage

* Manages persistent data beyond container lifecycle
* Types:

  * **Volumes** (preferred)
  * **Bind mounts**
  * **tmpfs** (for temporary data)
