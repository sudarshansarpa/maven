## What is a Docker Image?

A **Docker image** is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run an application — the **code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files**.

Think of a Docker image as a **blueprint or snapshot** of a container. It contains the instructions for creating and running a Docker container.


### 🔹 Key Characteristics of Docker Image:

* **Immutable**: Once built, a Docker image cannot be changed. Any updates require a new image build.
* **Layered**: Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer. Layers are stacked and cached for faster builds.
* **Portable**: You can move Docker images across systems and environments without modification.
* **Read-only**: Docker containers run from read-only images. The container itself adds a writable layer on top.


### 🔸 Example:

When you run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

Docker pulls the **Nginx image** from Docker Hub (if not already available locally), runs it in detached mode, and maps port **8080 on your host** to port **80 in the container** where Nginx listens by default.


### 🔹 Components Inside the Nginx Docker Image:

* **Base Operating System** (e.g., Debian or Alpine)
* **Nginx web server binary** (precompiled)
* **Default Nginx configuration files**

  * `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
  * `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`
* **Default HTML content** (served from `/usr/share/nginx/html`)
* **Start-up command**:
  Defined in the image via `CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]` to keep the container running.

### 🔸 Where Are Docker Images Stored?

* **Locally**: On your system under Docker’s storage (can be listed using `docker images`).
* **Remotely**: On Docker registries like [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).
