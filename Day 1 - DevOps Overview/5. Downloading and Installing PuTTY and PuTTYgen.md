### **What is PuTTY and PuTTYgen?**  

#### **🔹 PuTTY**  
PuTTY is a free, open-source SSH and Telnet client for Windows, used to connect to remote servers securely. It supports multiple network protocols like **SSH, Telnet, SCP, and SFTP**.  
📌 **Common Uses:**  
- SSH into Linux servers  
- Secure remote access  
- Transfer files via SCP/SFTP  
- Debug network services  

#### **🔹 PuTTYgen**  
PuTTYgen (**PuTTY Key Generator**) is a tool used to generate SSH key pairs. Since PuTTY uses **.ppk** (PuTTY Private Key) format, PuTTYgen is used to:  
✅ Generate new SSH key pairs (public/private)  
✅ Convert **.pem** (AWS key format) to **.ppk**  
✅ Export keys to **OpenSSH** format for other clients

1. Open the downloaded **`pageant.exe`** file.  
2. It will start running in the background (tray icon near the clock).  
3. To open it, click the **Pageant icon** in the system tray.

## **🔑 How to Add a Private Key to Pageant**
1. **Right-click the Pageant tray icon** → Select **"Add Key"**.  
2. Browse and **select your `.ppk` file** (PuTTY Private Key).  
3. Enter the **passphrase** (if applicable).
