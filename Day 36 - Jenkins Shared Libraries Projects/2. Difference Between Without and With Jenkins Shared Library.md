## Difference Between Without and With Jenkins Shared Library

### 🔴 **Without Jenkins Shared Library**

Each Jenkins pipeline contains **duplicate code**, even if multiple pipelines perform similar tasks.

#### 📌 Structure:

* Each **project** (Project 1, 2, 3) has its **own Jenkinsfile**.
* Logic for building, cloning, testing, etc., is **repeated** across all Jenkinsfiles.
* If a change or fix is needed (e.g., update to Docker build logic), it must be made **individually in every project**.

#### 🔻 Problems:

* **Code duplication**
* **High maintenance overhead**
* **Error-prone updates**
* **Inconsistent logic:** Pipelines may drift over time due to copied code changes.
* **No reuse:** You can't reuse logic easily across jobs or teams.
* DevOps engineers spend time **updating every Jenkinsfile** separately.

### 🟢 **With Jenkins Shared Library**

Common logic is written once in a **shared library**, and reused across all Jenkinsfiles using simple function calls.

#### 📌 Structure:

* A central **Jenkins Shared Library** contains reusable `.groovy` functions like:

  * `gitClone.groovy`
  * `buildCode.groovy`
  * `dockerBuild.groovy`
  * `dockerImagePush.groovy`
* Each **project Jenkinsfile** just calls these functions.
* If a fix is needed, you **update it once** in the shared library, and all projects automatically benefit.

#### ✅ Benefits:

* **Centralized logic**
* **Single place to update/fix**
* **Faster rollout of improvements**
* **Cleaner Jenkinsfiles**
* **Scalable for many microservices and branches**

| Feature                     | Without Shared Library        | With Shared Library            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Code Reuse                  | ❌ No                          | ✅ Yes                          |
| Maintenance                 | 🔺 High (update each project) | 🔽 Low (update once centrally) |
| Risk of Errors              | ✅ High                        | ❌ Low                          |
| Consistency Across Projects | ❌ Manual enforcement          | ✅ Automated via shared logic   |
| Setup Complexity            | ✅ Simple (per file)           | 🟡 Moderate initial setup      |
| Scalability                 | ❌ Poor for many projects      | ✅ Excellent for large setups   |
