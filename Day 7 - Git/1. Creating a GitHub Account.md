### What is GitHUb

- **GitHub** is a **web-based platform** used primarily for **version control** and **collaboration** on software development projects.

4. **Branching & Merging**: Developers can work on new features in isolated branches and merge them into the main codebase after review.
5. **Pull Requests**: Propose code changes and have them reviewed and discussed before merging.
6. **CI/CD Integration**: Supports automated workflows, testing, and deployments using GitHub Actions.
7. **Security**: Offers tools like Dependabot, code scanning, and secrets detection.
8. **Documentation**: Supports README files, wikis, and markdown files to document projects.
9. **Community**: Hosts open-source projects, allows starring and forking repositories, and encourages collaboration.

### Who Uses GitHub?
