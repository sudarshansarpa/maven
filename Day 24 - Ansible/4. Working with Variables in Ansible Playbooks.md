## 📄 **Working with Variables in Ansible Playbooks**

### ✅ Purpose

Define a list of packages as a variable and use it to install multiple packages using a loop.

## 🧾 Playbook Example with Variables

```yaml
---
- name: Install packages using variables
  hosts: localhost
  become: true

  vars:
    package_list:
      - git
      - httpd
      - wget
      - tree

  tasks:
    - name: Install common packages
      yum:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop: "{{ package_list }}"
```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save this as `install_with_vars.yaml`
2. Run it with:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook install_with_vars.yaml
   ```

## 📌 Notes

* `vars:` section defines the variable `package_list`.
* `loop:` is the modern alternative to `with_items` (both are supported, but `loop` is preferred).
* `{{ item }}` is used to access each value from the list during the loop.
