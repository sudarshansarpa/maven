### ✅ What is an Ansible Playbook?

An **Ansible Playbook** is a YAML-formatted file used to define a series of tasks to automate the configuration, deployment, and management of systems.


### 🧾 Key Features:

* **Written in YAML**: Easy to read and write.
* **File Extensions**: `.yaml` or `.yml`

  * Example: `install.yaml`, `deploy.yml`
* **Sequential Execution**: Tasks in a playbook are executed **in order**, top to bottom.
* **Human-readable**: Designed for both human readability and machine execution.


### 🧱 Playbook Structure:

A playbook typically consists of:

* **Hosts**: The target machines to apply tasks on.
* **Tasks**: List of actions/modules to run.
* **Handlers** (optional): Run tasks only when notified (e.g., restart a service).
* **Variables** (optional): For parameterizing playbooks.


### 🧩 Sample Playbook: `install.yaml`

```yaml
- name: Install and start Apache
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes  # run with sudo privileges
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Start Apache service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
```

### ▶️ How to Run a Playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook install.yaml
```
