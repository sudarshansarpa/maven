# What is Dockerfile

 Dockerfile is a file used to build our own docker images by giving some instructions to customize an existing docker images based on our requirement in an automated way without running a docker container.  
File name is Dockerfile.



# Why Dockerfile is Required?

- We have a lot of pre-existing docker images available in the Docker Hub registry. They can be pulled directly and we can use them for our need.
- But still, we may need to customize the existing docker images based on our requirement.
- So Dockerfile helps us to build our own docker images automatically as per the instructions given.



# Exploring the Instructions in Dockerfile

Dockerfile Instructions Commands are:
- `FROM`  
- `MAINTAINER`
- `LABEL`
- `ADD`
- `COPY`
- `CMD`
- `ENTRYPOINT`
- `ENV`
- `ARG`
- `EXPOSE`
- `RUN`
- `USER`
- `VOLUME`
- `WORKDIR`



# Dockerfile Syntax?

Dockerfile syntax consists of two kinds of main line blocks:

- **# Comment**
- **INSTRUCTION arguments**

### A Simple Example:
```dockerfile
# Print "Hello docker!"
RUN echo "Hello docker!"
````



# `FROM` Instruction

- The `FROM` instruction specifies the underlying OS architecture that you are going to use to build the image.
- You have to use some  base image for you to get started with building an image.

Example:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest
```



# `MAINTAINER` Instruction

`MAINTAINER` instruction is used to specify the author who creates this new docker image for the support.

Examples:

```dockerfile
MAINTAINER Administrator
MAINTAINER admin@techworldwithmurali.com
MAINTAINER DevOps Engineer (admin@techworldwithmurali.com)
```



# `LABEL` Instruction

`LABEL` instruction is used to specify metadata information for an image. A LABEL is a key-value pair.

Examples:

```dockerfile
LABEL "Project"="NGINX Static Site"
LABEL "Author"="Moole Muralidhara Reddy"
LABEL "Environment"="Development"
```



# `ADD` Instruction

- `ADD` instruction is used to copy files, directories, and remote URL files to the destination (docker container) within the filesystem of the docker images.
- `ADD` also has two forms - Shell Form and Executable Form.

Examples:

* **Shell Form**:

```dockerfile
ADD index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
```

* **Executable Form**:

```dockerfile
ADD [ "index.html",  "/usr/share/nginx/html" ]
```

If the `src` argument is a compressed file (tar, gzip, bzip2, etc.), then it will extract at the specified `dest` in the container’s filesystem.



# `COPY` Instruction

- `COPY` instruction is used to copy files, directories, and remote URL files to the destination (docker container) within the filesystem of the docker images.
- `COPY` instruction also has two forms - Shell Form and Executable Form.

Examples:

* **Shell Form**:

```dockerfile
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
```

* **Executable Form**:

```dockerfile
COPY [ "index.html",  "/usr/share/nginx/html" ]
```

If the `src` argument is a compressed file (tar, gzip, etc.), then it will copy exactly as a compressed file and will not extract.



# `CMD` Instruction

- The `CMD` instruction is used to set a command to be executed when running a container.
- There must be only one `CMD` in a Dockerfile. If more than one `CMD` is listed, only the last `CMD` takes effect.
- `CMD` has two forms - Shell Form and Executable Form.

Examples:

* **Shell Form**:

```dockerfile
CMD nginx -g 'daemon off;'


```

* **Executable Form**:

```dockerfile
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```



# `ENTRYPOINT` Instruction

- The `ENTRYPOINT` instruction is used to configure and run a container as an executable.
- `ENTRYPOINT` also has two forms - Shell Form and Executable Form.

Examples:

* **Shell Form**:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT /docker-entrypoint.sh
```

* **Executable Form**:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]
```

- If the user specifies any arguments (commands) at the end of the `docker run` command, the specified commands override the default in `CMD`.
- But `ENTRYPOINT` instructions are not overwritten by the `docker run` command, and `ENTRYPOINT` will run as it is.



# `EXPOSE` Instruction

- `EXPOSE` is used to inform about the network ports that the container listens on runtime.
- Docker uses this information to interconnect containers using links and to set up port redirection on the Docker host system.

**Examples:**

```dockerfile
EXPOSE 80 443
EXPOSE 80/tcp 8080/udp
```



# `RUN` Instruction

-  `RUN` is used to execute any commands on top of the current image, creating a new layer.
-  `RUN` has two forms - Shell Form and Executable Form.

Examples:

* **Shell Form**:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl vim && \
    apt-get clean
```

* **Executable Form**:

```dockerfile
RUN ["apt-get", "update"]
```



# `VOLUME` Instruction

`VOLUME` is used to create or mount a volume to the Docker container from the Docker host filesystem.

Examples:

```dockerfile
VOLUME /opt

```



# `WORKDIR` Instruction

`WORKDIR` is used to set the working directory.

Examples:

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html
```



# `ENV` Instruction

-  `ENV` is used to set environment variables with key and value.
-  These variables will be available during the image build and also after the container is launched.

Examples:

```dockerfile
ENV SITE_DIR=/usr/share/nginx/html
```



# `ARG` Instruction

`ARG` is also used to set environment variables with key and value, but these variables are only available during the image build, not at runtime.

Examples:

```dockerfile
ARG VERSION=1.0
```



# `USER` Instruction

`USER` is used to set the username, group name, UID, and GID for running subsequent commands. By default, the root user is used.

Examples:

```dockerfile
USER username
USER username:groupname
USER 1010
USER 1010:1205
```
