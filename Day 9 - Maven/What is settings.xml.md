## **What is settings.xml?**  

The **Maven settings.xml** file is used to configure Maven's behavior, including:  
- Defining the **local repository** location.  
- Specifying **alternate remote repository servers**.  
- Storing **authentication credentials** for private repositories.  

For example, a **Nexus repository** username and password can be declared inside the `<server>` tag within the `settings.xml` file.

---

## **Location of settings.xml**  

Maven can use two `settings.xml` files simultaneously:  

1. **Global Settings (applies to all users on the system)**  
   - Location: `$M2_HOME/conf/settings.xml`  
   - This is the global configuration file for Maven, located inside the Maven installation directory.  

2. **User-Specific Settings**  
   - Location: `${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml`  
   - This is the user-specific configuration file, located in the home directory of the user running Maven.  

### **Settings File Precedence**  
- Both files are optional.  
- If both are present, the values in the **user-specific** `settings.xml` (`~/.m2/settings.xml`) override the values in the **global** `settings.xml` (`$M2_HOME/conf/settings.xml`).
