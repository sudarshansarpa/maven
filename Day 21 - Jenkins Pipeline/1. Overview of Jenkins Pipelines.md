### 🔧 What is Jenkins Pipeline?

- In simple terms, a **Jenkins Pipeline** is a set of plugins that supports **continuous integration** and **continuous delivery (CI/CD)** workflows.
- It allows you to define and automate the steps needed to **build, test, and deploy** your application using a scripting language called **Pipeline DSL (Domain-Specific Language)**.


**Key Features:**

* Automates the software delivery process.
* Supports complex workflows with branching, parallel execution, and error handling.
* Enables pipeline as code through version control.


### 📄 What is a Jenkinsfile?

- A **Jenkinsfile** is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline.
- It is stored alongside your source code (typically in the root of your project repository).

It allows you to **implement pipelines as code**, which means your CI/CD process is:

* **Version-controlled**
* **Easily reviewable**
* **Reusable and portable**


### ✅ Benefits of Using Jenkinsfile

1. **Pipeline as Code**
   Define, edit, and version your CI/CD process just like your application code.

2. **Consistency Across Environments**
   One Jenkinsfile can work across all branches and pull requests.

3. **Collaboration**
   Multiple developers can contribute to the pipeline configuration.

4. **Auditability**
   Any changes to the pipeline are tracked via source control (e.g., Git).

5. **Web UI and File-based Support**
   Pipelines can be created via the Jenkins UI or defined in a Jenkinsfile.


### 🧾 Types of Syntax in Jenkinsfile

Jenkinsfile supports two types of syntax:

1. **Declarative Syntax** *(Recommended)*

   * Simpler and more structured.
   * Easier for beginners.
   * Example:

     ```groovy
     pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
         stage('Build') {
           steps {
             echo 'Building...'
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Scripted Syntax**

   * Uses full Groovy syntax.
   * Offers more flexibility for complex workflows.
   * Example:

     ```groovy
     node {
       stage('Build') {
         echo 'Building...'
       }
     }
     ```

> 📝 *Best Practice:* Use **Declarative** for most use cases; switch to **Scripted** when you need advanced logic or dynamic behavior.
